# File Renamer

## About
This project is part of my journey into learning programming and improving my Python skills. It automates file renaming with various options like adding timestamps, changing case, and replacing spaces with underscores.

## Features
- **Add Timestamp**: Append the current timestamp to filenames.
- **Convert to Lowercase**: Rename files using only lowercase letters.
- **Add Prefix**: Add a specified prefix to filenames.
- **Replace Spaces with Underscores**: Convert spaces in filenames to underscores for better compatibility.

   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).

```sh
python Add_Timestamp.py
python Lower_Case.py
python Prefix_Change.py
python Space_to_Underscore.py
